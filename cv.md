### About Me

I've been studying Front-End for 6 months. In december was my very first expierence in RS-Shool but it seemed too hard with 0 knowledge of IT.


So I've dicided to get more knowledge with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla-javascript and have an oportunity to succed the course.

  let allSubjects = Object.keys(this.marks);
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < allSubjects.length; i++) {
    result += this.marks[allSubjects[i]].reduce(function (prev, crnt) {
    return prev + crnt;
    }, 0);
  }
  return result / allSubjects.length;
}
